### Any cool stuff you're working on?

Although that statement is completely up for your own judgement, here's some stuff I've put a significant part of my life into:

- **[Voxel](https://diamonddigital.dev/voxel-beta)** - Multi-purpose Discord Bot with an ever-growing number of features.
- **[EcoBot](https://dsc.gg/discord-ecobot)** - Discord economy bot that allows you to create server shops using roles as items.
- **[DiamondLLM](https://chat.diamonddigital.dev/)** - A conversational AI chatbot fine-tuned from Meta's LLaMA 3 with quality close to that of GPT-4.
- **[Codeshare](https://codeshare.diamonddigital.dev/)** - A beautifully simplistic pastebin alternative, heavily focussed on ease-of-use and mobile-friendliness.
- **[Diamond Media Player](https://github.com/WillTDA/Diamond-Media-Player)** - An Electron-based media player for Windows with advanced audio visualisation and LUFS metering capabilities.
- **[NPM Packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~willtda)** - There's quite a few, take a look!

### Where can I reach out to you?

I don't have many social outlets, but my main is Discord, especially on my server.

If you wanna see what I'm up to outside of my programming lifestyle, my Instagram also exists for that reason.
